# Ï† vs Î·â‚€ Dataset for Open Channel Flow Design

## Description

This dataset captures the variation of the dimensionless function:

\[
\phi = f(\eta_0, m)
\]

where:

- **Ï•** is a dimensionless parameter defined as:  
  \[
  \phi = \frac{nQ}{\sqrt{S} \, B^{8/3}}
  \]

- **Î·â‚€ = y/B** is the ratio of the normal depth (*y*) to the bottom width (*B*).

- **m** represents the side slope factor (horizontal : vertical) of the channel.

---

This dataset is useful while designing **channels for irrigation in open channel flow**. It provides a **convenient aid to determine the normal depth** in both **rectangular (m=0)** and **trapezoidal (m>0)** channels.

## How This Dataset Was Created

The values were generated using Finite Element Method (FEM) techniques.

##  Dataset Format

The Excel file contains:

- A column for *Î·â‚€ (y/B)*.
- Multiple columns for *Ï• values*, each corresponding to a different side slope:
  - `m = 0` â†’ Rectangular channel  
  - `m > 0` â†’ Trapezoidal channels (e.g., m = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5)
