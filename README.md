# DatasetOCF
While designing channel for irrigation in open channel flow, this Dataset is of variation of φ = f(η0 , m) as represented by nQ/sqrt(S)B^8/3 and provides a convenient aid to determine the normal depth in rectangular and trapezoidal channels. At the normal depth. η0 = y/B note m=0 corresponds to rectangular channel
